# Entertainment_Booking_System 
This project provides a database for a system that allows people to purchase tickets of entertainment shows such as movies, sports matches, audio launch events, etc. <br> 
This system stores various information like tickets bookings, event details and also history of events and bookings. <br> 
We had used PostgreSQl for creating our database using PgAdmin 4. <br> 
A SRS document of this system is also attached.<br>
